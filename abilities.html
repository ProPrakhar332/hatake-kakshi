        <P>Kakashi is very adept in taijutsu. In the anime, as a child, he was skilled enough to hold his own against his sensei, Minato Namikaze, in his bell test, managing to touch one of the bells while engaging the more experienced shinobi unarmed, and with assistance from his team, actually snatch one. As an adult, his skills improved considerably. Even when greatly outnumbered by hundreds of enemies, he is easily able to defeat them, using well-coordinated attack patterns to handle the multiple enemy strikes.</p>

            <p> 
            
            Kakashi is also able to fight on par with Might Guy, a rival and taijutsu master, ever since childhood. Likewise, from his various challenges against and mission with Guy, Kakashi has copied and developed considerable skill in his friend's fighting style of Strong Fist and several of its techniques, enough to train others in its usage. He is also noted to have impressive speed; being able to intercept an opponent even from a distance as seen during the very start of the bell test. His speed allow him to effectively catch his opponents off-guard to quickly strike them down and easily evade attacks. Even against highly experience assassins, Kakashi can silently sneak-up on them, making him prime to strike.<br>
             His speed increased considerably in Part II; before the timeskip he had difficulty keeping up with Itachi Uchiha, but he outmaneuvered him after the timeskip. Kakashi has also shown remarkable reflexes, able to instantly react and manoeuvre out of surreal danger. Likewise, his hand seal prowess has also been noted as being very great, able to perform them at highly difficult speeds to follow.</P>

        <P>While used less often, he has also shown proficient skill in genjutsu due to his sharingan, which he can use as a set-up for stronger attacks. His skill in its usage is able to easily deceive most opponents with well-timed diversions, giving his opponents little chance to counter. During the bell test for Team 7, Kakashi was able to use low-level techniques to easily subdue a keen-minded and natural genjutsu-type like Sakura. Against most high-level techniques, he has advanced knowledge of their working, and is able to dispel genjutsu as well. He was also able to battle an adult Obito in a genjutsu duel to a standstill.</p>

        <P>Kakashi primarily relies on his mastery of ninjutsu, possessing both great skill and otherwise knowledge of which he has gained a vast arsenal due in part to his Sharingan; being noted to have copied over a thousand techniques, the number has continually been growing through his many battles. With this arsenal, he can attack or defend in numerous manners. He can immediately discern what type of technique he has encountered the nature behind it. While a student under Minato Namikaze, Kakashi among other things learned how to use the Rasengan. He also demonstrated noticeable skill since childhood in advanced techniques like the Shadow Clone Technique.</p>

                Kakashi is proficient in several nature transformations. He has a natural affinity for Lightning Release, which he mastered before even becoming a jōnin. It became so advanced that it is an attribute enemy ninja identify him by. His prowess with Water Release can match specialists like Zabuza Momochi and perform techniques without a nearby water source. His Earth Release prowess is able to move fast and unnoticed underground or produce large and intricate earthen walls rather quickly. In the anime, he has also shown considerable skill in Fire Release, able to produce a massive fireball able to cause much damage to the area. In addition, he is at least knowledgeable enough to train others in Wind Release.</P>

        <P>Summoning Jutsu (also known as Kuchiyose no Jutsu) is a space–time ninjutsu that allows the summoner to transport animals or people across long distances instantly via blood.Kakashi is also able to summon a pack of ninja hounds of various breeds. Much like his combat skills, Kakashi's use of these summons is highly versatile, ranging from attacking and restraining his opponents. He can combine his Summoning Technique and his Earth Release skills to have his hounds burrow and erupt from the ground in order to help subdue his enemies. Aside from offensive purposes, Kakashi's pack is also highly skilled in tracking down targets, and often used to deliver messages.</P>

        <P>Kakashi's most distinguishing ability was the Sharingan in his left eye-socket that was given to him by Obito Uchiha. Since the eye got transplanted into him, Kakashi's ability to copy nearly any technique used against him gave him the moniker Copy Ninja Kakashi (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi) while utilising many of the Sharingan abilities including genjutsu, seeing through deception, and predicting his opponent's next move. This eye also gave Kakashi a heightened visual perception to his surroundings, enabling him to perfect his Chidori and its later version, the Lightning Cutter. While fighting Obito, a potent genjutsu user, Kakashi was able to go toe to toe with his enemy in an illusionary fight until he himself asked that genjutsu fighting be abandoned due to the constant stalemates of it.</p>

            <p> 
                Kakashi awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan after unintentionally killing Rin Nohara, though seemed unaware of its awakening until years later. Its design is three stretched triangles evenly spaced around the pupil that each curve at the top around the eye to form a circle, making it similar to a pinwheel. With it he can perform Kamui: a technique that creates a space-time barrier in the form of a swirling void that sucks any target he focuses his eye on to another dimension and also bring them back; even transporting them to a new location. Originally, Kakashi lacked proper control to accurately hit his target. His skill and aim later improved greatly, able to successfully warp small, fast-moving, or multiple targets in rapid succession as seen against Pain, and Sasuke respectively. He used the technique during the Fourth Shinobi World War.</P>

        <P>Repeatedly, Kakashi has proven himself to be a very shrewd and resourceful man, regularly having his opinion asked for by Tsunade, the Fifth Hokage. By a quite young age, Kakashi had enough experience on the battlefield to detect a hiding enemy's presence, impressing his sensei, Minato, and in the anime deceive Orochimaru, greatly injuring the Sannin in the process. Kakashi has even been noted to be smarter than Shikamaru Nara, a ninja well-known for his insightful, and calculating nature. His instincts also allow him to calmly effectively perceive and react to any incoming danger.</p>
            <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/pPfcukPGgdpmM/giphy.gif"  width="45%" style="float:left;margin-left:0;top: 0; padding: 10px;">
            <p> 
            
                His long career as a jōnin, and formerly as an Anbu, have only expanded his knowledge, allowing him to handle virtually any situation. For these reasons Kakashi has been assigned to a variety of teams — always as the leader — and he is always able to work well with his team-mates.<br>
                Kakashi has also shown repeatedly to be a highly capable teacher. He has come up with various unorthodox methods to help his students produce impressive leaps in their abilities in weeks what would normally take months if not years of intense training.

        <P>Originally, Kakashi's primary weakness was his average reserves of chakra and stamina. He could only maintain his Sharingan for a short time, quickly tiring out from overusing it and ultimately collapsing if used too long, followed by great difficulty to even stand for days. He also stated he could only use his signature technique, Lightning Cutter, four times in a single day before it wouldn't work.</P><br>
        <img src="https://giffiles.alphacoders.com/209/209876.gif" width="45%"  style="float:right;margin-right:0;top: 0; padding: 10px;" ><br>
        <P>Over the course of the series, his reserves improved considerably to extend his timespan and versatility to fight multiple high-level opponents. By Part II, he can maintain his Sharingan for an entire day and utilize several chakra-taxing techniques in quick succession unfazed, including his Lightning Cutter at least six times. His chakra reserves development is best seen with his Mangekyō Sharingan technique, Kamui. Originally, a single use tired him greatly. Using it more than twice in a single day would leave him crippled for over a week. By the time of the Fourth Shinobi World War, he was able to fight throughout an entire day right before going to fight against Tobi and his Six Paths of Pain which comprised of reincarnated jinchūriki. Once arriving, he was able to use Kamui several times in quick succession before finally collapsing as his eye started bleeding. Shortly afterwards, he recovered enough to stand up on his own and soon leapt back into action, using Kamui yet again, along with several other chakra-taxing techniques.</P>

        <P>A man who epitomizes versatility, Kakashi's expertise is not limited to the three major ninja skill sets; he is renowned for his tracking abilities and has otherwise displayed proficiency with trap-making, medical, survival, escapism, stealth, subterfuge, and assassination. Kakashi is also noted to have a better sense of smell than Kiba Inuzuka did in Part I, a noteworthy member of a clan with canine-like senses. Even without sight, Kakashi is still a highly formidable fighter, able to use his other senses and knowledge of his surroundings, allies, and enemies to perceive the situation and overwhelm his opponents. Kakashi has also developed considerable prowess in fūinjutsu, something that Orochimaru found impressive given Kakashi's age.</P>

        <P>Kakashi is also a master of disguise. He occasionally diaguises himself as a reporter name Sukea to secretly spy on genin and students to learn about them or pull pranks on them. The disguise involves a wig, contacts, face markings to hide hia scar and an altered voice.</P>
