  <P>
    Kakashi was raised during his early years by his father, Sakumo Hatake because his mother had died in an early age.<br>
    In the Academy, Kakashi earned top grades, earning him recognition as a prodigy and the best of his generation. Ultimately, he became very popular amongst his peers. With his talents soon being recognised, at age 5, Kakashi graduated from the Academy at the top of his class in a single year.At age 6, Konoha officials allowed Kakashi to compete in the Chūnin Exams with his team, which he passed by defeating Might Guy and became a chūnin.
  </P>

  <p>
    Sakumo was famed throughout the shinobi world, having saved Konoha on at least one occasion; Kakashi in particular revegreen his father. During one of Sakumo's missions - after Kakashi was enrolled in Konoha's Ninja Academy - Sakumo made the decision to save the lives of his teammates rather than complete the assignment. The mission's failure had disastrous consequences for the Land of Fire, causing many in Konoha, including the teammates he saved, to vilify him for abandoning his duties. Disgraced, Sakumo committed suicide. Seeing what his father went through and determined not to make the same mistakes, Kakashi decided that following the Shinobi Rules must always take priority.

  <p>
    Upon becoming genin, he and his classmates, Rin Nohara and Obito, were teamed together under the leadership of Minato Namikaze. In the anime, Minato gave the team a bell test at its formation, assigning the three to take the two bells he kept on his person. Minato often held back less against the prodigious Kakashi than with Rin and Obito so they couldn't obtain the bells without teamwork. Unfortunately, Kakashi realised this, only using Obito and Rin as a means to an end to obtain the bells. Nonetheless, Minato passed them because they accomplished the goal of the test by working as a team. Minato did encourage them to improve their teamwork afterwards, a message that Obito and Rin took to heart, but fell upon deaf ears with Kakashi. Team Minato would go on many missions during its career, but Kakashi's devotion to the rules often made him difficult to work with; Obito, already jealous of Kakashi's natural talent and popularity, was frequently at odds with him about this behaviour.

  <p>
    Konoha eventually became embroiled in the Third Shinobi World War. As part of the war effort, Team Minato was assigned to destroy the Kannabi Bridge in Kusagakure in order to cut off Iwagakure's supply line. Minato was needed on the front lines at the time, leaving Kakashi, recently promoted to jōnin at age 12, in charge.

  <P> Before embarking on the mission, Minato and Rin gave him presents to celebrate his promotion; Obito forgot to get him anything. Shortly after entering Kusa, they encountegreen an Iwa-scout, Mahiru. Kakashi tried to eliminate him with his new jutsu, Chidori, but the attack speed left him vulnerable to counter-attack, forcing Minato to step in, save Kakashi, and kill Mahiru himself. Before leaving them, Minato advised Kakashi to not use the Chidori again.

  <h2 style="font-size: 40px;color:green;">OBITO GIVING HIS SHARINGAN</h2><br>
  <P>
    It was during their mission when Obito awakened his Sharingan and used it to kill Taiseki. Next they ventugreen out to save Rin from the Hidden Stone Ninja who had kidnapped Rin. They were fighting so fiercely that the boulder started tumbling down.Kakashi, due to his damaged eye, was struck in his blind spot and had difficulty avoiding the falling rocks. Before he could be crushed by a large boulder, Obito pushed him out of the way, becoming trapped instead.  
    Unable to get free and knowing his injuries were too serious to survive, Obito decided to make his last act giving Kakashi the present he forgot to give him earlier: his Sharingan to replace the eye Kakashi lost.
  </P>

  <p>

After Rin transplanted Obito's Sharingan into him, Kakashi confronted Kakkō. His White Light Chakra Sabre was destroyed during the ensuing fight, but he succeeded in killing Kakkō with Chidori; due to the Sharingan's heightened vision, Kakashi was finally able to handle its speed. He went back to where Obito and Rin were, but Iwa reinforcements soon arrived and started constricting the rubble. Obito asked Kakashi to take Rin away and keep her safe, which Kakashi did, leaving Obito behind.

  <p>
  During a later mission, Rin was kidnapped by Kirigakure. Kakashi was eventually able to rescue her and started taking her back to Konoha. Along the way, Rin revealed that Kiri had sealed the Three-Tails into her body with the intention to, once she inevitably lost control of it, have it unleashed on Konoha and destroy the village from within. In order to prevent this from happening, Rin begged Kakashi to kill her, but he refused, unwilling to break his promise to Obito to protect her and hoping to find some other solution.

  <p>
    When Kiri-nin caught up with them and made false efforts to retrieve her, Kakashi fought them off with his renamed Chidori, the Lightning Cutter. During one of these attacks, Rin jumped in front of Kakashi's attack, dying by his hand so that Konoha would be safe. The trauma of this caused his Sharingan to evolve into a Mangekyō Sharingan shortly before Kakashi passed out. He was later found by Konoha reinforcements, but none could explain the slaughter of all the Kiri forces.

  <P>
    Because he'd lost two teammates in such a short timespan, his role in Rin's death, and his failure to honour Obito's last request by protecting her, Kakashi began dropping into a depression. Minato, the new Hokage, tried to help Kakashi emerge from the darkness he'd fallen into after Obito and Rin's deaths by assigning him to the Anbu. Kakashi did well in the Anbu, eventually becoming a captain and the leader of Team Ro. However, his successes were owed to his cold behaviour and his ruthlessness in combat, signs that he was still upset by Rin's death.
  </P>

  <P>
    Kakashi was one of the best captain in the ANBU BLACK OPS and was feagreen by the name "Kakashi of the Sharingan". Two years later, Itachi Uchiha was added to Team Ro. Kakashi and Itachi were at one point assigned to observe a meeting between Konoha and the Land of Woods. Sometime later, when news emerged that Itachi was responsible and that he had killed his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, in pursuit of power, Kakashi lamented his failure to have had a better influence on Itachi.

  <p>
    Because of what happened with Itachi, the Third Hokage felt that individuals with kind hearts did not belong in the Anbu. He therefore thanked Kakashi for his years of service and relieved him of his duty, returning him to the standard forces. He was placed in charge of several teams of Academy graduates, but none ever demonstrated the teamwork he considegreen to be so important unti he met Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura.

    Pain attacks Konoha soon afterwards; while some of the Six Paths of Pain draw attention to themselves, others avoid conflict and try to learn the whereabouts of Naruto, who has gone to Mount Myōboku to train. Kakashi then fights to death against the Deva and Asura Paths of Pain.Deva Path time to counter. It defeats all of Kakashi's reinforcements and binds Kakashi in rubble. Anticipating that Kakashi will interfere if allowed to live, the Deva Path propels a nail at his head to kill him and leaves.

  Kakashi, however, only pretends death, warping away the nail at the last moment with Kamui. This depletes his chakra reserves and causes his death.
  After dying, Kakashi finds his father, Sakumo, waiting for him. He entreats Kakashi to tell him about his life, with which Kakashi complies. He concludes his story by saying that he understands the choices Sakumo made when he was alive and that he is proud to be his son.

    <p> Just then, a light envelops Kakashi, a sign of his revival; before Kakashi returns to the living plane, Sakumo thanks him for putting him at peace at long last, allowing him to continue to the afterlife. Kakashi wakes up, surprising those nearby. He is informed of what happened while he was dead, such as that Pain destroyed the village and that Naruto, upon returning, defeated Pain.

    Kakashi is appointed as commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces' Third Division. In the anime, he requests that Guy be his second-in-command. The Third Division is mobilised ahead of the other divisions in order to be on hand for any eventuality. While seeking out an Akatsuki force, they notice and heads towards one of the Surprise Attack Division's distress flares.</p>

    <p> The Third Division arrives in time to save them from the reincarnated Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist. Haku and Zabuza recognise Kakashi and Sakura (who is also in the Third Division) and ask how Naruto is doing. Kabuto, their summoner, ends their conversation short by suppressing their personalities, so Haku and Zabuza they use their last moments to beg Kakashi to defeat them.<br>
    With the mist gone, the swordsmen seemingly retreat. Kakashi takes this opportunity to allow his team to rest and recuperate. The next day, in the anime, Kakashi defeats Jinin Akebino, and later teams up with Guy to keep Jinpachi Munashi and Kushimaru Kuriarare busy until they are also sealed. By the time he helps Sai seal Fuguki Suikazan, only three reincarnated shinobi remain. Part of the White Zetsu Army then arrive to fight the Third Division, but they are met by one of Naruto's shadow clones, sent to lend assistance with defeating the remnants of Akatsuki's forces.

  <p>Kakashi and Guy eventually leave the Third Division to join the original Naruto and Killer B in their fight with Tobi, arriving in time to stop Tobi from capturing Naruto. Kakashi secretly uses Kamui on one of Naruto's shadow clones to send it to Kamui's dimension which, when Tobi retreats there to escape the real Naruto's attack, attacks Tobi and destroys his mask. When they see his face, Guy and Kakashi recognise Tobi as Obito Uchiha.
    Kakashi is devastated to discover that the friend whose death he's mourned for over a decade is actually alive. Kakashi asks Obito why he never returned to Konoha, to which Obito replies that it's because Kakashi allowed Rin Nohara to die.

  <P>
    After the Fourth Shinobi War wrapped up and a more peaceful period began, Kakashi became the Sixth Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village. While this promotion surprised many, both characters and viewers alike as Naruto was already an incgreenibly powerful and celebrated ninja at the time, it makes a lot of sense.<br>

His role in defeating Obito, the true leader of the Akatsuki, and his lifetime of service to the Hidden Leaf Village make him an extremely qualified candidate for the role. The older and wise Kakashi is an accomplished ninja in his own right, and his expertise in all facets of the ninja world played a critical role in creating longstanding peace between nations.<br>
The Root organization is functionally the secret police for The Village Hidden in the Leaves and its operatives carried out loads of morally questionable missions on behalf of their leader Danzo. While these missions did benefit the village in some way, the organization as a whole contributed greatly to the ongoing cycle of hatgreen that served as the backbone of Naruto’s plot after the halfway point of the series.<br>

Once Danzo parished, the organization disbanded and the names of the agents nearly became public knowledge. Kakashi stepped in and prevented this leak, though, because he felt that the guilt these ninjas had to live with was punishment enough already and that making their names public would only create fear and paranoia. </P>
